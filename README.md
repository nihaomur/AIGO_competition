# AIGO Competition - Predict House Value
This is a competition hosted bt *Bank SinoPac* and *Trendmicro*, the purpose is **using ML method to predict house price**. </p>
I'd made a presnetation of my work and uploaded it on my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHKnk4oO_f0) with the [ppt attachment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TtM6ZHAStXn6w2Whlg3uxuen6iA1zAG0/view?usp=share_link
), feel free to leave any comment and discussed with me.

## Feature Engineering
The most important of my work was I made a whole new feature by connecting the **Actual Price Registration of Real Estate Transactions**.</p>
I wrote a for loop to traverse the train data and Real Estate Transactions data to find out the estimate price by intersectional location(in street scale).
You would see the detail in [this file](finding_average_price_1111.ipynb).
